"""
Per-document legibility header — Sprint 1 of the AI-consumer roadmap.

The downstream LLM consuming /context today sees a block like:

    <expressed_context>
    spliced text from document 1
    ---
    spliced text from document 2
    </expressed_context>

It has no way to tell WHICH tier fired each document, WHICH documents are strong
hits vs reaches, or HOW MUCH content was compressed away. The consumer
council (2026-04-14) flagged this as the biggest single-shot legibility
win available.

This module emits one metadata line per document block, consolidating all
three Sprint 1 asks from `docs/FUTURE/AI_CONSUMER_ROADMAP_2026-04-14.md`
into a single ~50-60 token prefix:

    [document=abc12345 ◆ fired=harmonic:2.3,lex_anchor:1.1 1000→200c]
    <spliced content>
    ---
    [document=def67890 ◇ fired=sema_boost:1.8 180c]
    <spliced content>

Covers:
    1. Fired-tier tags per document (top-3 by contribution)
    2. Hash preview — short gene_id links back to the full content + the
       raw→compressed char ratio signals whether to re-query via the
       forthcoming /context/expand endpoint (Sprint 3)
    3. Confidence marker derived from z-normalized retrieval score across
       the retrieved document set: ◆ strong (z≥1), ◇ moderate (0≤z<1), ⬦ weak

The format is pure-text; no markup changes, no schema migration. Any
downstream consumer can strip it by skipping lines starting with `[gene=`.
