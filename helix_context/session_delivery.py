"""
Session working-set register — Sprint 2 of the AI-consumer roadmap.

Every /context call today is stateless: the same LLM querying Helix 20-60
times in one conversation pays full token cost for overlapping document sets
delivered on nearly every turn. The expected ~40% token reduction comes
from elidng documents the consumer already holds.

This module owns the `session_delivery_log` table — one row per
(session_id, gene_id, delivered_at) triple — plus the thin DAL the
pipeline uses to check "have I already shipped this?" before assembly
and to "I'm shipping this now" after.

Design notes:

* **TTL is per-session, unbounded in time.** A row never expires on a
  clock; it expires only when its `session_id` stops being referenced
  by incoming /context calls. A future sweeper can purge sessions whose
  most-recent delivery is > N days old, but the MVP keeps everything.
* **Scope is per-session, not per-party.** Federation (share deliveries
  across sessions under the same party) is a later concern; the simpler
  model gets the consumer most of the way.
* **Content hash is over the EXPRESSED text**, not the raw document. Different
  splice modes of the same document count as distinct deliveries, because the
  downstream LLM genuinely saw different strings.
* **Opt-out exists.** Callers that *want* redundancy (benchmarks running
  controlled fixtures, eval rigs measuring per-call quality) pass
  `ignore_delivered=true` and bypass the whole check path. They still
  emit delivery rows so future non-opt-out calls see an accurate log.

Schema is co-located in `Genome._create_schema` alongside cwola_log so
the tables migrate together. This module exposes a bare `ensure_schema`
for the in-memory test fixture path — production always gets it via
knowledge store init.
