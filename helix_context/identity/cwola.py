"""
CWoLa label logger - STATISTICAL_FUSION.md sect C2 (Sprint 1 half).

Captures per-query rows so the Sprint 3 trainer can bucket them into
A (accepted: no re-query within 60s) and B (re-queried within 60s on
the same session) and train a classifier under the Metodiev/Nachman/
Thaler 2017 (arXiv:1708.02949) Classification Without Labels theorem.

This module only logs and assigns buckets lazily. The trainer is a
separate Sprint 3 module that reads this table.

Sprint 1 uses same-session-within-60s as the bucket-B proxy, ignoring
semantic similarity. The Sprint 3 trainer can recompute buckets using
query embeddings (Singh 2020 Context Mover's Distance or cosine) before
fitting.
