`/context/expand` — Sprint 3 of the AI-consumer roadmap.

A dedicated endpoint for 1-hop graph traversal from a known gene_id,
letting the consumer follow a thread without spinning up a fresh
`/context` query.

Today the LLM consuming /context has to reverse-engineer the retrieval
to expand on something it just saw:

    "I got document=abc12345 fired=harmonic:2.3 — what's connected to it?"
    → invent a synthetic follow-up query → /context → run all 6 pipeline
    steps → pay 2-8k tokens, most of it redundant

This module short-circuits that. Given a gene_id and a direction, walk
the existing co-activation graph (or the document's stored
`co_activated_with` list) and return a compact summary of the 1-hop
neighborhood — sub-100 tokens typical, no compressor splice, no rerank.

Three directions (per roadmap):
    forward:  harmonic_links.gene_id_a = X   (things X points to)
    backward: harmonic_links.gene_id_b = X   (things that point at X)
    sideways: gene.epigenetics.co_activated_with (the document's own
              memory of what it's been co-retrieved with)

When `session_id` is provided, the response filters out documents the
consumer already has (via session_delivery_log), so expand responses
stay non-redundant with the conversation's running context.
