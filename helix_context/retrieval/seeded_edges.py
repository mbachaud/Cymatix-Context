Sprint 4 - Seeded co-activation edges with Hebbian evidence decay.

Solves the "cold-start graph-topology" gap flagged in Sprint 2:
brand-new OPEN documents have no co_activated_with history, so the Tier 5
harmonic boost and Tier 5.5 SR propagation cannot surface them on the
first few retrievals after ingest. Seeding edges at ingest time - when
multi-signal agreement suggests two documents are semantically linked -
gives new documents a "social standing" in the graph before the first
retrieval lands.

Design
------
Three edge classes, provenance-tagged on harmonic_links.source:
  seeded            weight_mul 0.3   - admitted on multi-signal agreement
  co_retrieved      weight_mul 0.7   - observed co-retrieval in retrieval
  cwola_validated   weight_mul 1.0   - classifier-confirmed (Sprint 3)

Each edge carries Laplace-smoothed evidence counters:
  co_count          - # co-retrievals (both endpoints in retrieved set)
  miss_count        - sum of dense-rank weighted miss events

Effective weight during retrieval scoring:
  ratio = (co_count + 1) / (co_count + miss_count + 2)
  weight = raw_weight * source_mul * ratio

This gives new seeds Optimistic Neutrality (ratio=0.5 at no evidence),
promoting with sustained co-retrieval and attriting under contradiction.

Promotion thresholds:
  seeded -> co_retrieved         co_count >= 3 AND ratio >= 0.4
  co_retrieved -> cwola_validated (deferred to Sprint 3 trainer)

Pruning: effective weight < PRUNE_FLOOR drops the edge entirely.

Miss counting uses dense-rank so tied documents at the cutoff share the
same miss_weight, preventing stable-sort artifacts from creating
"persistent bad-luck" seeds.
