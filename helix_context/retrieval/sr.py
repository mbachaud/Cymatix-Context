Successor Representation - Tier 5.5 retrieval boost.

Stachenfeld, Botvinick & Gershman (2017) "The hippocampus as a
predictive map" (Nature Neuroscience 20:1643). The SR matrix

    M = (I - gamma * P)^-1  =  sum_{k=0..inf} gamma^k * P^k

gives, for each state s, the gamma-discounted expected number of
future visits to every other state. Tier 5's harmonic boost is
effectively the k=1 slice of this; SR generalises to multi-hop
futures without densifying the whole matrix.

For helix's 18K-document knowledge store, dense M is 18K x 18K float32 = 1.3 GB.
We never build that. Instead, per query, we compute M[seed, :] via a
truncated sparse power series over the co-activation graph - one row
per seed, k_steps sparse matvecs.

Per-row cost at k=4 and branching ~10 is ~10^4 ops, sub-millisecond.

Integration: slots between Tier 5 (harmonic, 1-hop co-activation) and
the access-rate tiebreaker in query_genes(). Contributes a "sr" bonus
per document to the tier_contributions dict alongside the existing tiers.

See SUCCESSOR_REPRESENTATION.md for design + validation notes.
