HelixContextManager -- The pipeline orchestrator.

Orchestrates the full /context pipeline per turn:
    1. Extract tags signals from query (heuristic, no model)
    2. Retrieve -- find relevant documents via tags matching + co-activation
    3. Re-rank -- score candidates via compressor (CPU, optional)
    4. Splice -- compress each candidate, keep high-value fragments (CPU, batched)
    5. Assemble -- build the 3k compressor prompt + 6k retrieved context window
    6. Persist -- pack query+response exchange into knowledge store (background)

Token budget:
    3k  = compressor decoder prompt (fixed, tells big model how to read fragments)
    6k  = retrieved context (fragment-encoded, spliced)
    600k = knowledge store (cold storage, never fully loaded)

# ── Stage-timer context manager ──────────────────────────────────────
# Wraps each named pipeline stage with a monotonic-clock measurement and
# records a single OTel histogram entry on exit. Exceptions in telemetry
# are suppressed so a broken collector never kills the pipeline.
#
# In addition to the OTel histogram, each stage entry is appended to a
# bounded in-process ring (the "pipeline viewer" feed). The ring is
# scoped per build_context() call via a contextvar holding the request_id
# so the dashboard can group events back into per-request rows.

    Wraps a zero-arg factory (e.g. the DeBERTa hybrid ribosome: two

    double-checked lock. Until then the serving process pays nothing for
    it — part of the fix for the 20.3 GB-RSS-at-boot eager stack, where
    every process (tray backend, bench server, build workers) loaded the
    full encoder stack whether or not the workload touched it (the
    #176/#191 3-CUDA-context incident class).

    Any public attribute access (``re_rank``, ``splice``, ``encode``,
    ``classify_relations``, ``backend``, …) materializes the real object
    and forwards to it, so behavior after first use is identical to the
    eager construction. Private/dunder lookups raise AttributeError
    instead of forcing a load, so stdlib introspection (copy/pickle/repr
    machinery) can never accidentally pull in a multi-GB model.

    If the factory raises, the failure is logged once and the proxy

        ----------
        domains, entities, max_genes:
            Standard hot-tier retrieval inputs.
        query_text : str, optional
            Original natural-language query. Required if cold-tier
            fallthrough fires (used by ``Genome.query_cold_tier`` to
            encode the SEMA query vector). Defaults to None — when None,
            cold-tier is skipped even if config-enabled.
        include_cold : bool, optional
            Per-call override of the ``[context] cold_tier_enabled``
            flag in helix.toml. ``None`` (default) uses the config flag,
            ``True`` forces cold-tier on, ``False`` forces it off.
            Plumbed from the /context endpoint's ``include_cold`` body
            parameter so callers can opt in/out per request without
            touching the config file.
        party_id : str, optional
            Caller's party identity. When provided, ``query_genes``
            excludes documents attributed to OTHER parties (cross-party
            leakage prevention) and grants a +0.5 score bonus to documents
            attributed to this party. Unattributed legacy documents remain
            retrievable regardless. ``None`` = no filtering, no bonus
