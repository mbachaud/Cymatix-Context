Scoring blend: apply cymatics + harmonic bin + TCM as post-retrieve refiners.

Extracted from ``context_manager.py`` (Sprint refactor, 2026-05). The
``blend_mode="legacy"`` path is byte-identical to the inline
``_apply_candidate_refiners`` method it replaces -- only the calling
convention changed (explicit parameters instead of ``self``).

Blend-mode knob (Issue #255 / audit §4 item 5, 2026-07-10)
----------------------------------------------------------
The blend layer runs three post-fusion refiners over the candidate set:

* **cymatics** — spectral flux score, scaled by an absolute ``0.5``
  (``blend.py`` cymatics block; the ``* 0.5`` literal). Adds to
  ``genome.last_query_scores`` and re-sorts candidates.
* **harmonic_bin** — overtone-series boost, already normalized to ``[0, 1.5]``
  by ``ray_trace.harmonic_bin_boost`` (the ``w * 1.5`` at ``ray_trace.py:485``).
  Adds to ``genome.last_query_scores`` and re-sorts candidates.
* **TCM** — temporal-context bonus, ``max(0, 0.3 * sim)`` (``tcm.BONUS_WEIGHT``
  ``= 0.3``, bound here as ``weight=0.3``). Does NOT mutate
  ``last_query_scores``; it only re-sorts candidates by ``score + tcm_bonus``.

Every one of these is a *post-fusion mutation on an unspecified score scale*
(audit §2d, class d): ``0.5`` is a mild nudge on the legacy additive scale
(O(3-45)) but an overwrite on the RRF scale (O(0.05-0.5)). They also
contaminate the ``[know]`` logistic, which reads ``top_score``/``score_gap``
straight off the mutated ``last_query_scores`` map. This module exposes the
three modes below. GRADUATED 2026-07-13: ``"scale_relative"`` is now the
shipped default (serving-profile receipt,
``docs/research/2026-07-12-blend-serving-receipt.md``); ``"legacy"`` remains
available and byte-identical to the pre-knob inline block for anyone who sets
it explicitly.

``legacy``
    Absolute additive blend. ``score[g] += bonus`` for cymatics/harmonic;
    TCM sorts by ``score[g] + tcm_bonus[g]``. Byte-identical to the pre-knob
    inline block, so untouched configs are bit-for-bit unchanged.

``scale_relative``
    Convert each absolute additive bonus ``b`` into a **bounded multiplier**
    of the candidate's own score. For a signal with absolute cap ``C``
    (cymatics ``0.5``, harmonic ``1.5``, TCM ``0.3``) and a reference additive
    score ``S_REF`` (``_BLEND_SCALE_REF``)::

        signal_norm = clamp(b / C, 0, 1)          # ∈ [0, 1], scale-free
        w           = C / S_REF                    # preserves the signal's
                                                   #   relative magnitude at a
                                                   #   typical additive score
        score[g]   *= (1 + w * signal_norm)        # == 1 + clamp(b, 0, C)/S_REF

    The ``C`` cancels for in-range ``b``, so the mapping reduces to the clean
    form ``score[g] *= (1 + b / S_REF)``: an absolute bonus ``b`` scales the
    candidate's own score by the fraction ``b / S_REF`` it *would* have
    represented on a typical additive score, instead of adding a fixed amount.
    Because every bonus is independent of the input score magnitudes and the
    map is multiplicative, the emitted order is **invariant under uniform
    rescale of the input scores** (multiplying every score by ``c > 0`` scales
    every product by the same ``c`` — order preserved). That is the invariance
    the additive form breaks: a fixed ``+0.5`` flips rankings as the score
    scale shifts (the very defect audit §2d flags). The relative magnitudes of
    the three signals are preserved: with ``S_REF = 10.0`` the per-signal max
    boosts are cymatics ``×1.05``, harmonic ``×1.15``, TCM ``×1.03`` — the same
    ``0.5 : 1.5 : 0.3`` ratio as the additive constants, now bounded.
    ``S_REF = 10.0`` is a representative mid-band additive score (audit §2d
    cites additive tier scores as O(3-45); 10.0 sits inside that band). It is
    a documented module constant, not a per-signal hand-tuned exchange rate.

``off``
    Skip the blend mutations of ``last_query_scores`` entirely: none of the
    three refiners run their scoring/sort step, so ``last_query_scores`` is
    left exactly as fusion produced it and candidates keep their pure-fused
    order. The refiners' one **non-scoring** side effect — the rerank/model
    truncation of the candidate list to ``max_genes`` — still runs. This
    clears the desk-test off-cell exact-inversion floor
    (``docs/research/2026-07-10-rerank-combinator-desktest.md`` §5): that floor
    is exactly this blend layer mutating order under the lexical probe.

Note on ``[know]`` (audit item 7): the ``[know]`` confidence logistic reads
``top_score``/``score_gap`` off ``last_query_scores`` (``context_packet.py``).
``blend_mode="off"``/``"scale_relative"`` therefore change what ``[know]``
sees; this knob does NOT touch ``[know]`` behavior itself. Graduation landed
2026-07-13 (serving-profile receipt,
``docs/research/2026-07-12-blend-serving-receipt.md``), so the s_ref/g_ref
re-fit that was sequenced BEHIND this knob (audit §4 item 7) is now unblocked
— tracked on #239, and must run under the new ``scale_relative`` default.
