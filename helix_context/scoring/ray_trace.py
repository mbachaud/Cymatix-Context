"""
Monte Carlo evidence propagation over the document co-activation graph.

Ports the ScoreRift ray-trace pattern into a retrieval dimension for
helix-context.  Casts random rays from seed documents through co-activation
edges (``co_activated_with`` + ``harmonic_links``), accumulating energy
at terminal nodes.  High-energy terminals are "supported by evidence"
from the seed set and receive a retrieval boost.

Origin story (2026-04-11):
  Max asked "why are my RT cores sitting at 0%?" while staring at the
  GPU performance panel during a helix bench run.  The chain that
  followed:

    1. RT cores do hardware-accelerated ray-trace against BVH structures
    2. Could we repurpose that for something other than triangles?
    3. Monte Carlo ray-tracing is the CPU fallback for when you don't
       have RTX hardware
    4. Monte Carlo over a graph IS evidence propagation
    5. Which is what ScoreRift's ``cast_ray`` already does on compliance
       dimensions
    6. Which maps onto the document co-activation graph...
    7. → this module exists

  The current implementation is pure Python on CPU.  The RT cores are
  still sitting at 0%.  The real version would encode the co-activation
  graph as a BVH and cast OptiX rays through it — ~1000x throughput,
  hardware-accelerated nearest-neighbour in high-dim SEMA space, and
  actual physical justification for the ray-trace framing.  That's a
  rabbit hole for another night.

Design decisions:
  - Adjacency built from 2-hop neighbourhood of seeds (keeps graph local)
  - harmonic_links weight multiplied when available; else neutral (1.0)
  - Boost normalised to [0, 2.0] for safe addition to query_genes() scores
  - Reproducible via ``random.Random(seed)``
