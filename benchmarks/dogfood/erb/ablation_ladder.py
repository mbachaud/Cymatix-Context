"""ablation_ladder.py — in-process per-layer ablation probe for the ERB beds.

One retrieval layer is disabled per arm against a ``baseline`` arm that runs
the shipped config untouched. The point is a cost/impact re-probe: what does
each layer buy in rank quality, and what does it cost in wall time?

Every arm is built from a FRESH ``load_config()`` object mutated for that arm
and a FRESH ``CymatixContextManager`` (config is per-manager, and several
gates are read once at construction into ``KnowledgeStore`` attributes — a
mid-run mutation would not take).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Verified query-time gates (file:line, this worktree)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Every knob below was traced from ``config.py`` through manager construction to
the *branch that actually runs at query time*. Arms whose candidate knob had
no such branch are DROPPED, with the evidence recorded in the receipt under
``dropped_arms`` (and repeated below).

KEPT
  no_splade      [ingestion] splade_enabled

                              'ann_dense_leg' (knowledge_store.py:3906)

  no_sema        [ingestion] sema_embed_on_ingest  (#227 semantics: this is the
                 GLOBAL sema switch, not merely an ingest-write flag — it gates
                 codec *materialisation*, so the query side dies with it)
                 config.py:291 -> context_manager.py:903-935 (self._sema_codec
                 stays None when false) -> context_manager.py:953 (sema_codec=)
                 -> knowledge_store.py:665 -> knowledge_store.py:2848

                 signal key: 'sema_boost' (knowledge_store.py:2894)

  no_cymatics    [cymatics] enabled
                 config.py:390 -> context_manager.py:1216 (self._use_cymatics)
                 -> context_manager.py:3119 (cymatics_enabled=)
                 -> scoring/blend.py:212 `if use_cymatics and cymatics_enabled ...`
                 NO signal key (the blend runs in the manager, not the store).
                 Validated by a call-probe on scoring.cymatics.query_spectrum,
                 which blend.py imports at call time (blend.py:214).

  no_synonyms    [synonyms] map emptied (config.synonym_map)
                 config.py:1097 -> context_manager.py:952 (synonym_map=)
                 -> knowledge_store.py:664 (self.synonym_map)
                 -> knowledge_store.py:1773-1784 `_expand_terms`, called first
                 thing in query_genes (knowledge_store.py:2305-2306).
                 NO signal key. Validated by probing ``_expand_terms`` directly
                 with the baseline map's own keys.

  rerank_on /    [retrieval] rerank_enabled   (#341)
  rerank_off     config.py:778 -> context_manager.py:1018 (rerank_enabled=)
                 -> knowledge_store.py:845 (self._rerank_enabled)
                 -> knowledge_store.py:4281 `if self._rerank_effective(
                 rerank_override) and scored:` (ANN path, the one the
                 receipts use) and :3692 `if _rerank_on and ranked_ids:`
                 (lex path).
                 signal key: 'xenc_rerank' (knowledge_store.py:4308 ANN,
                 :3734 lex)
                 These are a PAIR, and only one of them is ever live for a
                 given config: rerank_on is an ENABLE arm (the shipped
                 default is False, so "ablating" it is a no-op) validated by
                 signal PRESENCE, rerank_off is the ordinary ablation
                 validated by signal absence. Whichever one matches the
                 loaded config's current value is identity-dropped at
                 runtime, which is exactly what makes the order-reversed A/B
                 (benchmarks/dogfood/erb/rerank_ab.py) safe to drive from a
                 single arm table.

  no_classifier  [classifier] enabled
                 config.py:886 -> context_manager.py:1801-1807 (classify_query
                 only called when enabled) -> assembly cap at :2101-2113 and
                 decoder hint at :1829.
                 NO signal key. Validated by the absence of
                 ``window.metadata["classifier"]`` (written at
                 context_manager.py:2316 only when classifier_result is not None).

CONDITIONAL — kept in the arm table, dropped at RUNTIME when the effective
config already sits at the ablated value (an ablation that changes nothing
measures nothing, and reporting it as a null result would be a lie):
  no_cold_tier   [context] cold_tier_enabled -> context_manager.py:3013-3018
  no_sr          [retrieval] sr_enabled -> knowledge_store.py:3162
  no_seeded_edges [retrieval] seeded_edges_enabled -> knowledge_store.py:3462
On the shipped cymatix.toml all three are already ``false`` (cymatix.toml:311,
:349, :359), so all three drop. The check is done against the LOADED config,
not against my reading of the toml, so a future flip re-arms them for free.

DROPPED (no query-time gate — see ``dropped_arms`` in the receipt)
  no_plr         [plr] enabled is consumed ONLY by the HTTP layer:
                 server/routes_context.py:635 -> server/helpers.py:444
                 ``_compute_plr_confidence``. retrieval/fusion_plr.py:31 says it
                 "leaves document ranking untouched" — it decorates the
                 /context/packet response with a query-quality log-odds. It is
                 not on the ``build_context`` path at all, so an in-process arm
                 would measure exactly zero by construction.

  no_harmonic    ``use_harmonic`` is a hardcoded ``True`` default on
                 context_manager.py:2895 (``_retrieve``) and
                 knowledge_store.py:2259 (``query_docs``), and NEITHER call site
                 (context_manager.py:1945, :1965) passes it — so it is a dead
                 parameter, never fed from config. The Tier-5 harmonic block
                 (knowledge_store.py:3119) and the co-activation pull-forward
                 (``_expand_coactivated``, knowledge_store.py:3494) are
                 therefore unconditional. ``[cymatics] harmonic_links`` looks
                 like the gate but is not: context_manager.py:2353 shows it
                 gates the ingest/expression-time edge WRITE, inside a
                 ``if not read_only`` block, not the query-time read.
                 No clean off-switch => dropped.

  no_tag_*       Tier 1 (tag_exact, knowledge_store.py:2697) and Tier 2
                 (tag_prefix, knowledge_store.py:2720) run unconditionally.
                 The #327 knobs are DISCIPLINE knobs whose ablated state is
                 already the default — ``tag_idf_enabled`` (config.py:660,
                 default False) and ``tag_df_cap`` (config.py:668, default 0.0)
                 turn discipline ON, so flipping them is an intervention, not
                 an ablation. The only mute available is weight-zeroing
                 (``tag_prefix_weight = 0.0``), which silences the tier's
                 contribution while still paying its SQL cost — that is not a
                 layer ablation and would misreport the cost axis. Dropped.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Self-validation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

An ablation that silently failed to apply is worse than no measurement: it
reports the layer as worthless. So every arm carries a positive observable and
is checked twice —

  1. The arm's expected observable must be ABSENT in the arm.
  2. The same observable must be PRESENT in the baseline arm. Without this the
     arm is *unfalsifiable* (e.g. 'hebbian' never fires under read_only=True,
     so "no hebbian" proves nothing), and it is recorded arm_valid=false with
     reason ``unfalsifiable`` rather than counted as a clean ablation.

``VALIDATION_SIGNAL_PRESENT`` (#341) is the same contract with both halves
inverted, for arms that ENABLE a layer instead of ablating one: the observable
must be PRESENT in the arm and ABSENT at baseline. An enable arm cannot be
validated by any of the absence kinds — "xenc_rerank never appeared" and "the
knob never applied" are the same observation there, so an enable arm checked
for absence is unfalsifiable by construction.

Baseline therefore always runs, even if ``--arms`` omits it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Measurement caveats (on the record)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

* Ranks come from ``manager.genome.last_query_scores`` — the same source
  ``benchmarks/dogfood/run_ladder.py`` uses. That map is POST-blend: the blend
  layer republishes it (scoring/blend.py:233, :281), so cymatics / harmonic-bin
  mutations ARE reflected. It is not, however, the delivered slice, so the
  receipt also records ``delivered_gold`` from ``window.expressed_gene_ids``.
* ``last_query_scores`` is a SCORE map, and a reorder that does not rewrite
  scores is invisible in it — which is exactly what the cross-encoder does
  (#341: it permutes ids, it does not republish fused scores). So the receipt
  also records the FINAL ORDER basis from ``manager.genome.last_ranked_ids``
  (``final_rank_of_first_gold`` / ``final_recall_hit`` per needle,
  ``final_recall_at_k`` per arm). Both bases ship: score-rank is the
  comparable-to-history one, final-rank is the one a rerank arm can move.
  Depth semantics differ by retrieval path — ANN publishes the full union
  pool, the lex path publishes the post-cut list (knowledge_store.py:940-949)
  — and these A/Bs run dense-on, i.e. the ANN semantics.
* ``last_ranked_ids`` / ``last_rerank_diag`` are store attributes with
  process lifetime, so run_arm CLEARS them immediately before each
  ``build_context`` call. A needle whose query never reaches the publication
  point (no-match early return, abstain, exception) then reads ``None``
  instead of inheriting the previous needle's order — the same staleness trap
  the splice ring-mark guards against.
* Ties are broken by ``gene_id`` ascending, not dict insertion order, so ranks
  are reproducible across arms and processes.
* Timings are wall ms on a shared box. Treat them as within-run relatives; no
  absolute-ms claim is made or asserted anywhere.
* The bed is opened read-write by ``KnowledgeStore`` construction (index/table
  DDL is idempotent-on-open), and queries pass ``read_only=True`` so
  ``touch_genes`` / ``link_coactivated`` / the Hebbian edge update never run
  (context_manager.py:2348, knowledge_store.py:3462). ``cwola_log`` is written
  by the HTTP route, not by ``build_context``, so an in-process run appends
  nothing there.
* The encoder daemon is the CALLER's business. This script never starts or
  stops one; it records ``encoder_client.active_url()`` and the dense codec's
  concrete class per arm so the receipt says which side the encode ran on.

Usage::

    python benchmarks/dogfood/erb/ablation_ladder.py --stamp 20260805-1200
    python benchmarks/dogfood/erb/ablation_ladder.py --arms baseline,no_dense
    python benchmarks/dogfood/erb/ablation_ladder.py --per-query   # paired basis
    python benchmarks/dogfood/erb/ablation_ladder.py --arms rerank_on  # #341

For the #341 rerank question specifically, drive this script through
``benchmarks/dogfood/erb/rerank_ab.py`` rather than by hand: it runs the
ladder twice with the base value reversed (so the ON side is not always the
second arm) and proves from the encoder daemon's own access log that the
cross-encoder really ran out-of-process.

``--per-query`` closes an audit gap: per-arm aggregates alone cannot tell you
WHICH needle moved between two arms, so no paired test can be run from the
receipt. With the flag, each arm carries one record per needle (gold ranks,
recall contribution, wall ms, per-signal ms) in the run order every arm shares.
Off by default, and off means the key is absent — not present-and-empty — so
existing receipts and readers are unaffected.
