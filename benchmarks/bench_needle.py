Benchmark: Needle in a Haystack

The standard test for context systems: can you find a specific fact
buried in a large knowledge base?

Plants 10 "needles" (specific facts) across ingested content,
then queries for each one. Measures:
  - Retrieval rate (did the genome express the right gene?)
  - Answer accuracy (did the model answer correctly?)
  - Latency per retrieval

This is the benchmark KV cache papers and TurboQuant use to show
information retention at various compression ratios.

Usage:

# Needles: specific facts that exist in the ingested content
# Each has a query and the expected answer substring
# Each needle has `gold_source`: a list of case-insensitive path
# substrings identifying the source file(s) that contain the answer.
# `found_in_context` checks that one of these sources is in the
# delivered gene set AND its block body contains an accept substring.
# Payload-wide substring matches are retained as `false_positive_substring`
# diagnostics. Waude diagnostic 2026-04-17 showed the old pure-substring
# check inflated delivery by counting URL port numbers and compression
# metadata as hits.
#
# Multi-valid-gold curation (2026-05-14): `gold_source` is an ANY-match
# list -- if ANY entry matches a delivered citation, the needle counts
# as gold-delivered. The historically labeled gold (the file in `source`)
# is preserved as the first list entry so older JSONL captures remain
# comparable. Per-needle rationale in docs/benchmarks/MULTI_VALID_GOLD.md.
#
# DO NOT add `helix-context/docs/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md` (the bench
# answer-key) to any needle's gold_source -- it would inflate the metric
# circularly.
