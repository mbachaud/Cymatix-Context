"""Multi-needle NIAH expanded to N=50.

Supersedes the N=8 probative set in `bench_multi_needle.py` with a
50-needle battery for publishable-quality numbers. Same scoring
(all_delivered, any_delivered, partial_recall per gold_source_groups)
so results are directly comparable to the 2026-04-19 N=8 snapshot.

The genome is the running main instance (~7800 genes across the
Education + helix-context + sibling repos). Needles cover eight
topic clusters so the score isn't dominated by any one area:

    cluster A — helix core (packet, pipeline, compression targets)
    cluster B — helix launcher / headroom integration
    cluster C — helix adapters / DAL / cache / retriever
    cluster D — helix claims layer (extraction, edges, DAG)
    cluster E — BigEd fleet config + skills
    cluster F — BigEd launcher + DB + ops
    cluster G — test / bench infrastructure
    cluster H — cross-cutting (docs, handoffs, shard registry)

Gold source groups use FILE path substrings. The content-recall metric
(`all_delivered`) is strict — at least one gene from every group must
be delivered. `partial_recall` and `any_delivered` soften that for
the long-tail diagnostic.
