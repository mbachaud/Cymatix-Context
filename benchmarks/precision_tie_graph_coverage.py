Pass 3b — associative-graph coverage on the tied pairs.

Question: do cymatix's existing associative tables have enough signal to
distinguish the tied genes? Three checks per tied pair:

    1. Direct edge — is there a harmonic_links row between gene_a and
       gene_b? If yes, they're explicitly co-activated; we already know
       they travel together and can tie-break on edge weight or direction.

    2. Neighborhood asymmetry — count distinct harmonic_links neighbors
       for each gene. If gene_a has 50 neighbors and gene_b has 200,
       gene_b is more "central" in the graph and may be the better
       surfacing choice under a centrality-aware tie-break.

    3. Query-entity affinity — for each query, find the entities that
       appear both in the query text and in entity_graph. Count how
       many map to gene_a vs gene_b. The gene with more query-entity
       matches wins the tie-break.

    4. (Bonus) gene_relations — NLI-typed logical relations. If
       gene_a entails / contradicts gene_b, that's structural info
       the tie-break should probably respect.

If any of (1)-(4) produces a clear asymmetry on most tied pairs, the
"walking" tie-break is implementable with data already in the genome.
If they come back flat, the graph isn't dense enough yet and tie-break
needs different signal (freshness, provenance, party_id, etc.).
