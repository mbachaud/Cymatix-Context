"""Delete orphan parent genes whose source file no longer exists on disk.

Parent gene IDs are derived from ``sha256(source_path + "::parent")[:16]``
(see ``CymatixContextManager._make_parent_gene_id`` — shipped 2026-04-16
with the layered-fingerprints work). That means when a source file is
moved or deleted, the old parent gene is NOT overwritten on re-ingest —
it becomes an orphan with dangling CHUNK_OF edges pointing at it.

This script finds those orphans (parents whose ``source_id`` no longer
resolves on the filesystem) and deletes them along with their
CHUNK_OF edges. Run it after any bulk file move (e.g. a ``docs/``
reorg) or periodic sweep.

Default: parents only. ``--include-children`` also sweeps child genes
whose source files are missing — useful when a file is deleted outright
rather than moved. Conservative default because a moved file's child
genes are still content-correct; only their ``source_id`` is stale.

Safety:
- Takes a write lock. Run while cymatix is stopped OR accept that the
  live server may momentarily see a shrinking genome.
- ``--dry-run`` prints what would be deleted without touching the DB.
- Takes no backup of its own. Make one first if you care:
  ``cp genome.db genome.db.pre-tombstone.bak``

Usage::

    python scripts/tombstone_orphan_parents.py --dry-run
    python scripts/tombstone_orphan_parents.py
    python scripts/tombstone_orphan_parents.py --include-children
    python scripts/tombstone_orphan_parents.py --genome path/to/other.db
