# Federation, Local-First — 4-Layer + Timezone Attribution

> *"The simplest path to federation is to use what the OS already knows."*

This document describes the local federation primitive shipped 2026-04-12.
It captures **4-layer** identity attribution for every ingested document
with zero auth infrastructure — using OS environment as the source of
truth. It's the on-ramp to the full enterprise federation model in
[`ENTERPRISE.md`](ENTERPRISE.md): same schema, different ID resolver.

## The 4-layer model + timezone forensics

Real-world identity has at least four independent axes that we want to
query separately, plus a temporal forensic axis (the IANA timezone in
which each document was authored):

| Layer | What it represents | Example | Why we need it separately |
|---|---|---|---|
| **org** | trust root / tenant / team | `swiftwing` | Compliance, billing, shared authorization scope |
| **device** (party) | physical substrate / execution host | `gandalf` | Cross-machine vs cross-account separation |
| **user** (participant) | human principal | `max` | "Who created this?" — the human in the loop |
| **agent** | software actor / AI persona | `laude`, `conductor` | "Which AI did the work?" — distinguishes Laude vs Taude vs manual |
| **+ tz** (forensic) | IANA timezone at write | `America/Los_Angeles` | Travel detection, DST drift, jurisdiction context |

Each document's `gene_attribution` row carries all four identity axes plus
the timezone. Any axis may be NULL — NULL `agent_id` = "manual ingest,
no AI involved." NULL `org_id` = defaults to the seeded `local` org.
NULL `authored_tz` = pre-2026-04-12 ingest (legacy).

### What timezone capture actually tells us (and doesn't)

The IANA name (`America/Los_Angeles`, `Europe/Berlin`, `Asia/Tokyo`)
labels a **DST rule set**, NOT a city. Vancouver, Seattle, and San
Francisco all use `America/Los_Angeles`. The honest framing:

| What it tells us | What it does NOT tell us |
|---|---|
| Which DST rule set the device is on | The user's actual city |
| Roughly which longitude band of the planet | Whether they're in CA vs WA vs BC |
| When the device's clock thinks it shifts (DST transitions) | Whether they're behind a VPN |
| Drift detection (rule set silently changes for same party) | Precise location ("where") |

Real geolocation needs IP / GPS / explicit input — separate features.
Timezone capture gives us a coarse longitude band + DST policy, which
is enough for travel detection ("Max wrote this from PT, then 6 hours
later from Berlin"), DST anomaly detection (silent offset shifts), and
rough jurisdiction context (timezone-based compliance hints).

### Two-axis tz storage

```sql
parties.timezone           -- "device's home" (last-write-wins, updated each ingest)
gene_attribution.authored_tz  -- per-write tz (forensic — captures travel)
```

Together these distinguish "where the device usually is" from "where
this specific document was actually written." Useful queries:

```sql
-- "Find genes authored in a different tz from the device's home"
-- (i.e., user was traveling)
SELECT ga.gene_id, ga.authored_tz, p.timezone AS device_home
  FROM gene_attribution ga
  JOIN parties p ON p.party_id = ga.party_id
 WHERE ga.authored_tz IS NOT NULL
   AND p.timezone IS NOT NULL
   AND ga.authored_tz != p.timezone;

-- "Detect when a device's home tz silently shifted"
-- (DST transition or laptop crossed timezones for an extended period)
SELECT party_id, authored_tz, MIN(authored_at), MAX(authored_at), COUNT(*)
  FROM gene_attribution
 GROUP BY party_id, authored_tz
 ORDER BY party_id, MIN(authored_at);
```

This lets us answer questions that would otherwise require human
forensics:
- *"What did SwiftWing produce this quarter?"* — filter by org
- *"What did the gandalf machine create today?"* — filter by device
- *"What did Max work on this week?"* — filter by user
- *"What did Laude specifically build?"* — filter by agent
- *"What did Laude on gandalf, on max's behalf, in SwiftWing, do?"* — composite

Terminology note: the canonical schema names remain `org`, `party`,
`participant`, and `agent`. In prose we may gloss them as trust root,
physical substrate, human principal, and software actor respectively.
See [`ROSETTA.md`](ROSETTA.md) for the translation layer.

## Schema

```sql
-- Layer 1: orgs (top-level tenant)
CREATE TABLE orgs (
    org_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    display_name  TEXT NOT NULL,
    trust_domain  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'local',
    created_at    REAL NOT NULL,
    metadata      TEXT
);
-- Seeded with ('local', 'Local Org (default)') so trust-on-first-use
-- writes always have a valid FK target.

-- Layer 2: parties (devices) — extended with org_id link
CREATE TABLE parties (
    party_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    display_name  TEXT NOT NULL,
    trust_domain  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'local',
    org_id        TEXT REFERENCES orgs(org_id),  -- added 2026-04-12
    created_at    REAL NOT NULL,
    metadata      TEXT
);

-- Layer 3: participants (humans) — unchanged
CREATE TABLE participants (
    participant_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    party_id       TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES parties(party_id),
    handle         TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- + workspace, pid, started_at, last_heartbeat, status, capabilities, metadata
);

-- Layer 4: agents (AI personas under a participant) — new
CREATE TABLE agents (
    agent_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    participant_id  TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES participants(participant_id),
    handle          TEXT NOT NULL,
    kind            TEXT,                  -- "claude-code", "gemini", ...
    created_at      REAL NOT NULL,
    last_seen_at    REAL,
    metadata        TEXT,
    UNIQUE (participant_id, handle)
);

-- The 4-axis attribution row
CREATE TABLE gene_attribution (
    gene_id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES genes(gene_id),
    org_id          TEXT REFERENCES orgs(org_id),               -- added 2026-04-12
    party_id        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES parties(party_id),
    participant_id  TEXT REFERENCES participants(participant_id),
    agent_id        TEXT REFERENCES agents(agent_id),           -- added 2026-04-12
    authored_at     REAL NOT NULL
);
-- Indexes on each axis × authored_at for fast filtered range queries.
```

What changes across federation tiers is **the source of those IDs**:

| Tier | org_id | party_id | participant_id | agent_id |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Solo / single-persona (today)** | `'local'` trust root | hostname / device | OS user UUID | NULL or `CYMATIX_AGENT` |
| **Multi-persona dev box** | `CYMATIX_ORG` env | hostname / device | OS user UUID | `CYMATIX_AGENT` per session |
| **Small team** | `CYMATIX_ORG` env | `CYMATIX_DEVICE` env | `CYMATIX_USER` env | `CYMATIX_AGENT` env |
| **Enterprise SSO** | OAuth org claim / tenant root | hostname / SaaS gateway | OAuth user claim | request header / agent token |

Because the schema is invariant, every document attributed at the local tier
remains validly attributed when SSO comes online. The auth edge replaces
the resolver; the rest of the pipeline (`query_genes(party_id=...)`, the
`/context` endpoint, the lifecycle tier tier rules) keeps working unchanged.

## How it resolves IDs today (4-axis + tz)

`cymatix_context/server.py::_local_attribution_defaults()` returns the
4-tuple `(user_handle, device, org, agent_handle)`:

```python
org           = os.environ.get("CYMATIX_ORG")    or "local"
device        = os.environ.get("CYMATIX_DEVICE") or os.environ.get("CYMATIX_PARTY") or socket.gethostname()
user_handle   = os.environ.get("CYMATIX_USER")   or getpass.getuser()
agent_handle  = os.environ.get("CYMATIX_AGENT")  or None   # None = manual ingest
```

And `_local_timezone()` resolves the IANA timezone name independently:

```python
1. CYMATIX_TZ env var                         # "America/Los_Angeles" — best
2. tzlocal.get_localzone_name() if installed # IANA, cross-platform
3. datetime.now().astimezone().tzname()     # display name on Win, abbrev on *nix
4. time.tzname[time.daylight]               # last-ditch
5. "UTC"                                    # always-resolves fallback
```

Why `CYMATIX_TZ` is prioritized: on Windows, `datetime.tzname()` returns
display names like "Pacific Standard Time" rather than IANA names. The
explicit env var is the only way to guarantee a clean IANA value
without adding `tzlocal` as a hard dependency.

Order of precedence, each axis:
1. **Explicit env var** (e.g., `CYMATIX_AGENT=laude`)
2. **Legacy env var** (e.g., `CYMATIX_PARTY` for back-compat with the
   2-layer commit)
3. **OS-derived value** (`getpass.getuser()`, `socket.gethostname()`)
4. **Sensible default** (`org='local'`, `agent=None`)

### `CYMATIX_DEVICE` parse rules (overload with the hardware picker)

The same `CYMATIX_DEVICE` env var is read by two consumers, and they
parse it differently. The overload is intentional and safe — this
section documents the parse rules so operators don't have to read
both consumers' code. Design decision recorded in
[ADR 2026-05-14](../adr/2026-05-14-spec-vs-code-design-decisions.md#q1-helix_device-overloaded-between-hardware-picker-and-federation-attribution).

| Consumer | Source | Parse rule |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware picker | `cymatix_context/hardware.py::_resolve_requested_device` | Lowercase, then check against the whitelist `{"auto", "cuda", "rocm", "mps", "cpu"}`. Any non-whitelisted value logs `WARNING` and is ignored — the picker continues to `[hardware] device` from `cymatix.toml`, then to `"auto"`. Never raises, never blocks startup. |
| Federation attribution | `cymatix_context/server/helpers.py::_local_attribution_defaults`, `cymatix_context/identity/registry.py` | Used as a free-form device-handle string. Any non-empty value is accepted as-is. Falls back to `CYMATIX_PARTY`, then `socket.gethostname()`. |

Concrete behavior matrix:

| `CYMATIX_DEVICE=` value | HW picker | Federation |
|---|---|---|
| `cuda` / `cpu` / `mps` / `rocm` / `auto` | Used as device kind | Used as device handle (literal value) |
| Any other string (e.g., `my-laptop`, `swift_wing21`) | WARNING logged, ignored; picker falls through to `[hardware] device` / `"auto"` | Used as device handle |
| Unset | Falls through to `[hardware] device` / `"auto"` | Falls through to `CYMATIX_PARTY` or `socket.gethostname()` |

**To silence the HW-picker WARNING when you want `CYMATIX_DEVICE` for
federation only:** set `[hardware] device = "cpu"` (or your preferred
device) explicitly in `cymatix.toml`, and move the federation label to
`CYMATIX_PARTY`:

```bash
export CYMATIX_PARTY="my-laptop"   # federation device handle
unset CYMATIX_DEVICE               # picker uses cymatix.toml's [hardware] device
```

This preserves attribution while avoiding the overload entirely.

Tokens are normalized: lowercased, whitespace-stripped, length-capped at
64 chars. Conservative because these become primary-key components.

Empirical verification (running server, `CYMATIX_ORG=swiftwing
CYMATIX_AGENT=conductor`):

```
gene_attribution:
  gene=08d02ea38de4..  org=swiftwing  dev=gandalf  user=max  agent=conductor
```

## How it wires through `/ingest`

When the request body provides no `participant_id`, the server walks
the 4-layer find-or-create chain (org → device → user → agent) using
`Registry.local_org()`, `local_participant(org_id=…)`, and
`local_agent()`. Each step is **trust-on-first-use**: first call creates
the row, subsequent calls reuse it.

```python
# In /ingest endpoint
if local_federation and not participant_id:
    user_handle, default_device, default_org, agent_handle = _local_attribution_defaults()
    effective_party = party_id or default_device
    effective_org   = org_id  or default_org

    # Layer 1: org
    if effective_org:
        org_id = registry.local_org(effective_org)

    # Layers 2 + 3: device + user (party.org_id link is set inside)
    if user_handle and effective_party:
        participant_id = registry.local_participant(
            handle=user_handle, party_id=effective_party, org_id=org_id,
        )
        if not party_id:
            party_id = effective_party

    # Layer 4: agent (optional — only if CYMATIX_AGENT is set)
    if agent_handle and participant_id and not agent_id:
        agent_id = registry.local_agent(
            handle=agent_handle, participant_id=participant_id, kind=agent_kind,
        )
```

Then `attribute_gene(org_id=…, party_id=…, participant_id=…, agent_id=…)`
writes the 4-axis row.

Caller can disable the auto-resolution by passing `"local_federation":
false` in the request body (useful when an upstream auth layer provides
IDs explicitly).

## Multi-persona setup (Laude / Taude / Raude / Conductor pattern)

Each persona's IDE plugin / session launches with its own
`CYMATIX_AGENT` env var. The user (`CYMATIX_USER` or OS user) and device
(hostname) stay the same — only the agent layer changes per session:

```bash
# Laude's VSCode plugin profile
export CYMATIX_ORG=swiftwing
export CYMATIX_AGENT=laude

# Taude's
export CYMATIX_ORG=swiftwing
export CYMATIX_AGENT=taude

# Raude's
export CYMATIX_ORG=swiftwing
export CYMATIX_AGENT=raude

# Conductor (main session, no specific persona)
export CYMATIX_ORG=swiftwing
export CYMATIX_AGENT=conductor
```

All four agents end up as distinct rows in the `agents` table under the
SAME `participant_id` (max), under the SAME `party_id` (gandalf), under
the SAME `org_id` (swiftwing). Each document each agent creates is
independently queryable:

```sql
-- "Show me everything Laude built this week"
SELECT g.gene_id, ga.authored_at, g.source_id
  FROM gene_attribution ga
  JOIN agents a ON a.agent_id = ga.agent_id
  JOIN genes g ON g.gene_id = ga.gene_id
 WHERE a.handle = 'laude'
   AND ga.authored_at > strftime('%s', 'now', '-7 days');

-- "Show me what the team built today, grouped by agent"
SELECT a.handle, COUNT(*) FROM gene_attribution ga
  JOIN agents a ON a.agent_id = ga.agent_id
 WHERE ga.org_id = 'swiftwing'
   AND ga.authored_at > strftime('%s', 'now', '-1 day')
 GROUP BY a.handle;

-- "Show me org-wide activity per device"
SELECT party_id, COUNT(*) FROM gene_attribution
 WHERE org_id = 'swiftwing'
 GROUP BY party_id;
```

## What this gives you for free, today

1. **Multi-agent attribution** — every document knows who created it
2. **Cross-machine separation** — `party_id = hostname` distinguishes
   dev box from laptop from server
3. **Cross-account separation** — `getpass.getuser()` distinguishes
   accounts on the same machine
4. **Audit trail** — `gene_attribution.authored_at` is a per-document
   creation timestamp by definition; Δq queries become possible
5. **Cleanup primitive** — `DELETE FROM gene_attribution WHERE
   participant_id = ?` is the start of a "forget this agent's
   contributions" GDPR-style flow

## What this does NOT give you (yet)

1. **Authentication** — anyone with API access can spoof `CYMATIX_AGENT`.
   Local trust model assumes the machine itself is trusted (typical for
   solo-dev boxes; not OK for multi-tenant production).
2. **Authorization** — there's no role-based access control over which
   documents a participant can read. `query_genes(party_id=X)` filters, but
   participant-level scoping isn't wired into retrieval yet.
3. **Cross-machine identity** — "max on gandalf" and "max on laptop" are
   two distinct participants today. SSO would unify them.
4. **Audit log of reads** — only writes are attributed. Per-query read
   logging is in `hitl_events` infrastructure but not yet auto-populated.

These gaps are exactly what the enterprise edge layer in
[`ENTERPRISE.md`](ENTERPRISE.md) addresses. The local-first design here
is the runway, not the runway's destination.

## Migration story when SSO arrives

When the OAuth edge layer ships:

1. New auth middleware runs **before** `/ingest` and `/context` endpoints
2. Resolves OAuth token → `(party_id, participant_id, role)`
3. Sets these on the request before forward
4. The ingest path sees `participant_id` already populated, **skips
   the OS fallback**, and writes attribution with the SSO-derived ID
5. Existing documents attributed at the OS tier remain valid — they just
   point to participant_ids that haven't been re-mapped to SSO IDs yet
6. A one-shot migration script can reconcile by joining
   `participants.handle` → SSO email lookup, updating `gene_attribution`
   to use the new participant_id

No data migration required for the documents themselves. Schema invariance
is the gift that keeps giving.

## How this connects to the conductor/librarian pattern

Per the brainstorm in this session: a conductor-orchestrated architecture
where cymatix is queried as a tool and sub-agents do the heavy lifting
benefits from per-call attribution. When a sub-agent ingests, its
`CYMATIX_AGENT=researcher-3` env var auto-attributes everything it learned.
The conductor can then ask "show me what researcher-3 found about X"
without any additional plumbing.

In other words: federation isn't just an enterprise compliance feature.
It's the substrate that makes multi-agent introspection cheap.

## Implementation footprint (2026-04-12, 4-layer + tz)

- **Schema additions:**
  - `orgs` table (4 columns + 1 index, seeded with 'local' default)
  - `agents` table (8 columns + 3 indexes)
  - `parties.org_id` column (added via ALTER, idempotent)
  - `gene_attribution.org_id` and `agent_id` columns (added via ALTER)
  - 2 new indexes on `gene_attribution` (by org, by agent, both with
    authored_at DESC for time-range filters)
- **registry.py additions:**
  - `Registry.local_org(handle)` — ~20 LOC
  - `Registry.local_agent(handle, participant_id, kind)` — ~40 LOC
  - `local_participant` extended with `org_id` parameter — ~10 LOC delta
  - `attribute_gene` extended with `org_id`, `agent_id` parameters and
    auto-resolution — ~30 LOC delta
- **server.py additions:**
  - `_local_attribution_defaults()` returns 4-tuple — ~30 LOC delta
  - `/ingest` walks the 4-layer find-or-create chain — ~30 LOC delta
  - Accepts `org_id`, `agent_id`, `agent_kind` in request body
- **client opt-out:** `"local_federation": false` in request body
- **dependencies:** none new (`os`, `socket`, `getpass` are stdlib)

Total: ~160 LOC across 3 files + 2 new tables + 2 new columns. Zero
new external dependencies. Zero auth infrastructure. Trust model: the
OS account is who you are; CYMATIX_ORG / CYMATIX_AGENT env vars override.

## A note on timezone backfill quality

The `gene_attribution.authored_tz` backfill for legacy pre-2026-04-12
rows uses `parties.timezone` as a best-effort fallback. This is only
accurate if the device's home timezone hasn't changed since those documents
were authored — which is fine for stationary dev machines but wrong for
travelers (a document authored in PT will be backfilled as Berlin if the
laptop's current home tz is now Berlin).

This is acceptable because:
1. Forensic queries can filter by `authored_at < commit_deploy_ts` to
   identify backfilled-vs-captured rows
2. NULL would be a stricter representation of "we don't know" but adds
   query complexity for a relatively small number of historical rows
3. Going forward, every new ingest captures `authored_tz` at write
   time, so the data quality is correct from this commit onward

If you need stricter historical accuracy, manually NULL out the
`authored_tz` for rows older than this commit's deploy timestamp.

## Migration: pre-4-layer rows

Existing `gene_attribution` rows from before 2026-04-12 had only
`(gene_id, party_id, participant_id, authored_at)`. After the schema
upgrade (`ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN`):

- `org_id` is backfilled to the parent party's org (or `'local'` if
  the party has no org link)
- `agent_id` stays NULL — historically pre-agent-layer ingests had no
  way to record this, and NULL is the honest answer

A one-shot backfill script handles the org_id population in batch:

```python
UPDATE parties SET org_id = 'local' WHERE org_id IS NULL;
UPDATE gene_attribution
   SET org_id = COALESCE(
     (SELECT org_id FROM parties WHERE parties.party_id = gene_attribution.party_id),
     'local'
   )
 WHERE org_id IS NULL;
```

Verified on the 2026-04-12 knowledge store: 100% of `gene_attribution.org_id`
populated, with a clean split between historical (`org_id='local',
agent_id=NULL`) and post-upgrade (`org_id='swiftwing',
agent_id=<conductor uuid>`).
