# Cymatix-Context Retrieval Dimensions

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-04-17 (working tree)
> **Knowledge store snapshot:** 19,738 documents (13,710 OPEN / 1,949 EUCHRO / 4,079 HETERO)
>
> **Status: LLM-free pipeline as of 2026-04-09 (CPU pipeline commit) +
> 2026-04-13 (Sprints 1-4).** Every dimension below — D1 through D9,
> including D6 cymatics rerank — runs on deterministic CPU math. The
> "LLM re_rank" mentioned in §D6 is the *legacy* fallback path; in the
> live config `rerank_enabled = false` and the active rerank, when on,
> is a pretrained cross-encoder MiniLM (classifier, not an LLM call).
> See [`PIPELINE_LANES.md`](PIPELINE_LANES.md) §"LLM boundary" for the
> full statement. Step 0 query-intent expansion is flag-gated
> (`[ribosome] query_expansion_enabled`); flip to `false` for a
> strictly LLM-free `/context`.

Auxiliary live tiers not counted as separate D-lanes:

- `path_key_index` Tier 0 compound retrieval is live and fires before D1/D2 fusion.
- `filename_anchor` exists as a dark-shipped lexical boost, but remains off in the default `cymatix.toml`.
- `SR` exists as a graph-expansion path under D8, but remains dark-shipped in the default `cymatix.toml`.

## Dimension Reference

### D1 — Semantic Content (FTS5 + SPLADE + ΣĒMA)

Three sub-tiers in a fusion pipeline:

| Sub-tier | Mechanism | Table/field |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | FTS5 full-text with synonym expansion | `genes_fts` |
| Tier 2 | SPLADE sparse term expansion | `splade_terms` |
| Tier 3/3.5 | ΣĒMA 20-dim cosine similarity | `genes.embedding` |
| Cold fallthrough | ΣĒMA cosine on heterochromatin | `genes WHERE chromatin=2` |

Related live adjuncts, not counted as separate dimensions:

- `path_key_index` Tier 0 compound retrieval (`path_token` + `kv_key`)
- optional `filename_anchor` lexical boost (dark-shipped by default)

### D2 — Tagging (promoter index)

Keyword + entity tag matching at retrieval time. Documents tagged at ingest via `promoter_index`.
Query terms expanded through `cymatix.toml [synonyms]`.

### D3 — Source Provenance

Density gate at storage boundary uses `source_id` for deny-list filtering.
Source authority bonus applies per-source scoring weight during retrieval fusion.

### D4 — Working-Set Access Rate

Windowed access-rate ring buffer replaces monotonic `access_count`.

- `EpigeneticMarkers.recent_accesses` — last 100 access timestamps
- `access_rate(gene, window_seconds)` — sliding-window rate computation
- Wired into density gate access-override path

### D5 — Chromatin Tier

Three-tier accessibility model with cold-tier reactivation:

| Tier | Chromatin | Default retrieval | Cold-tier fallthrough |
|---|---|---|---|
| OPEN | 0 | Always queried | — |
| EUCHROMATIN | 1 | Included with hot | — |
| HETEROCHROMATIN | 2 | Excluded by default | Opt-in via `include_cold` or automatic when hot returns ≤ `cold_tier_min_hot_genes` |

Content is preserved across all tiers (C.1 non-destructive compression).

### D6 — Cymatics (Frequency-Domain Resonance)

Maps retrieval onto wave physics. CPU-based (~5 ms) replacement for LLM re_rank (~2 s).

| Concept | Biology | Cymatics |
|---|---|---|
| Document | Resonant mode | Excited by query "frequencies" |
| Fragment weight | Spectral amplitude | Peak height in 256-bin spectrum |
| Co-activation | Harmonic coupling | Weighted spectral edges (`harmonic_links`) |
| Splice | Bandwidth filtering | Q-factor from `splice_aggressiveness` |

Integrated at Step 3 of `context_manager._express()` as a blended score bonus.
Current live path uses `query_spectrum()` + `flux_score_dispatch()` to add a
small bonus and re-sort candidates. The old "LLM fallback" language is legacy.

### D7 — Document Attribution (partial, live data path)

Schema and data flow are now live: `/ingest` can resolve or accept explicit
`org_id`, `party_id`, `participant_handle`, and `agent_handle`, and writes
`gene_attribution` rows when identity is known.

Current consumers:

1. **Per-party scoping** — `query_genes(..., party_id=...)` excludes documents attributed to other parties while still allowing unattributed legacy documents through.
2. **Citation enrichment** — `/context` citations can emit `authored_by_party` and `authored_by_handle`.

Still pending:

1. **Authorship-class scoring** — same-party or same-agent relevance bonus is not live yet.

### D8 — Co-Activation Graph (partial data)

Three data sources exist, and part of the graph stack is now read at query time:

| Source | Location | Rows |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy co-activation | `epigenetics.co_activated_with` | Per-document JSON |
| Entity graph | `entity_graph` table | Varies |
| Cymatics harmonics | `harmonic_links` table | 227k+ in current knowledge store |

Current live wiring:

- Tier 5 harmonic boost in `query_genes()`
- Step 3.20 harmonic-bin boost via `ray_trace.harmonic_bin_boost()`

Still partial:

- `entity_graph` is now a first-class retrieval signal (Tier 5b, Step 3C, 2026-05-08); dark-shipped (`entity_graph_retrieval_enabled = false`) pending bench gate
- SR (`sr_boost`) exists under D8; `sr_enabled = true` in cymatix.toml (flip 2026-04-22) but gate bench (2026-05-08) found no recall gain at N=50 — leaving enabled pending higher-N validation
- seeded edges exist but are dark-shipped by default

**SR Gate Bench Result (2026-05-08, N=50, SEED=42, gemma4:e4b, same knowledge-store A/B):**

| Axis | Axes | SR-OFF retrieval | SR-ON retrieval | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | key | 10.0% | 10.0% | +0.0pp |
| 2 | key+project | 10.0% | 8.0% | -2.0pp |
| 3 | key+project+module | 14.0% | 14.0% | +0.0pp |
| 4 | key+project+module+filename | 32.0% | 32.0% | +0.0pp |

Gate criterion: ≥2pp gain on any axis without regression on others.
Result: **GATE NOT MET.** No retrieval_pct gain on any axis. Axis-2 shows -2pp regression
(within N=50 noise floor of ±1 needle). SR's in_context_pct shows marginal +2pp on axes 2-3
but this does not clear the gate on the primary recall@1 metric.

SR remains enabled in cymatix.toml (flip 2026-04-22 was signal-positive in earlier sweep) and
does not harm latency. Recommend re-gate at N=200+ or with a larger knowledge-store snapshot before
deciding to disable or promote SR to a required-on tier.

### D9 — Temporal Context Model (built, lightly wired)

Howard & Kahana 2002 temporal context evolution equation now exists as a
per-session drift vector. It is not a primary recall tier inside
`query_genes()`; instead, it acts as a trajectory layer that lightly
reorders already-retrieved candidates.

Current live wiring:

- per-session TCM state is initialized in `HelixContextManager`
- Step 3.25 applies `tcm_bonus(...)` as a tiebreaker over current candidates
- optional theta-biased ray tracing can use TCM velocity, but that flag is off by default

## Decision Gates

| Dimension | Test | Ship if | Drop if |
|---|---|---|---|
| D4 | N=50 access_rate ON vs OFF | ≥1pp retrieval | Worse than monotonic |
| D6 | N=50 post-cymatics | ≥0pp (non-regression) + latency win | Retrieval degrades vs LLM re_rank |
| D7 | Party scoping + attribution correctness | No cross-party leakage; citations correctly attributed | Wrongly-scoped or misattributed data |
| D8 | Harmonic/ray-trace/SR A/B | ≥2pp retrieval or clear robustness gain | <1pp and no failure-mode reduction |
| D9 | TCM forward-recall asymmetry | Asymmetry visible in benchmark | No asymmetry — wrong or N/A |
