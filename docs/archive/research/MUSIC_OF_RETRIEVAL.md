A short note on a structural coincidence (or maybe not one) we noticed
after the 4-layer federation commit. Saving it here so it survives the
next compact, in case it turns out to mean something.

## The count

After the path_key_index commit (`8e294fc`) and the federation work
(`5563763`), the retrieval pipeline contains exactly 12 distinct
**signals** plus 1 **gate**:

### The 12 signals (ordered by current tier)

| # | Tier | What it measures |
|---|------|---|
| 1 | Tier 0 | **PKI** — compound (path_token, kv_key) lookup |
| 2 | Tier 1 | **exact promoter tag match** |
| 3 | Tier 2 | **prefix promoter tag match** |
| 4 | Tier 3 | **FTS5** — full-text content search |
| 5 | Tier 3.5 | **SPLADE** — sparse semantic |
| 6 | Tier 4 | **SEMA** — dense embedding (cold-tier fall-through) |
| 7 | Tier 5 | **harmonic boost** — co-activation reinforcement |
| 8 | — | **cymatics resonance** — Gaussian spectrum overlap |
| 9 | — | **cymatics flux** — adaptive bin weighting (∫ B⃗·dA⃗) |
| 10 | — | **TCM** — Howard & Kahana session drift |
| 11 | — | **ray-trace** — Monte Carlo evidence propagation |
| 12 | — | **access-rate** — windowed working-set heat |

**All twelve tones are deterministic CPU math — zero LLM calls.** PKI
and tag exact/prefix are SQLite index lookups. FTS5 is the SQLite
full-text engine. SPLADE and SEMA are pretrained encoders running
locally (sparse and 20-D dense, respectively — classifiers, not
generative models). Harmonic boost, cymatics resonance, cymatics flux
(Werman 1986 W1 or cosine), TCM session drift (Howard 2005), ray-trace,
and access-rate are all linear algebra and counting on data that's
already in the genome. The chromatic scale plays itself; nothing in
the 12-tone stack pauses to ask a language model for help. The LLM
sits at the answer-generation boundary downstream of this whole stack
(see [`PIPELINE_LANES.md`](PIPELINE_LANES.md) §"LLM boundary").

### The 13th: the octave (gate, not signal)

| Layer | Function |
|---|---|
| **`party_id` filter** | Returns the same fundamental at a different identity address — same gene shape, different tenant scope |

This is structurally identical to a musical octave: not a new note, but
the same note "doubled" — same frequency class, different absolute
position. In retrieval, the party filter doesn't add to the score; it
re-projects the same retrieval space into a different identity-scoped
view.

## Why the periodicity matters (and why it might not be coincidence)

Cymatics is already inside the engine — a 256-bin Gaussian frequency
spectrum per gene, with resonance overlap as a retrieval signal (see
[`helix_context/cymatics.py`](../helix_context/cymatics.py)). The
flux integral is doing exactly what physics does at field boundaries.
The harmonic_links table is recording overtone relationships.

So when the count of distinct retrieval signals lands on 12 — the same
count as the chromatic scale — and the 13th element is a "return to the
same note at a different octave," it's hard to call it pure coincidence.
Possible readings:

1. **Pure numerology** — there's nothing here, we just chose to count
   things in a way that lands on 12. (Always the boring possibility.)
2. **Convergent design** — frequency-domain retrieval inherently lands
   on twelvefold symmetry because that's what efficient spectral
   discrimination looks like in any system whose signals decompose into
   a finite basis. Music landed on 12 because of physical resonance
   constraints; helix may have landed on 12 for the same reason.
3. **Substrate honesty** — when you build retrieval out of biological /
   physical primitives (cymatics, ray-trace, co-activation, working-set
   heat), the result inherits the natural symmetries of those substrates.
   12 keeps appearing in nature for reasons we don't fully understand
   yet (atomic edge counts, neural microcircuit modularity, Schoenberg's
   chromatic basis). It would be more surprising NOT to see it here.

## What this gives us conceptually

If the 12-tone framing holds:

- **Octaves of attribution** — we already have it. `party_id` filter is
  an octave shift. `org_id` filter is another. Each layer of the 4-layer
  federation (org / device / user / agent) is another octave projection,
  shifting the same underlying retrieval shape into a different identity
  scope without changing its harmonic structure.
- **Modes** — different mood-shifts of the chromatic basis. We could
  define retrieval "modes" the way music defines Ionian, Dorian, etc:
  emphasize different subsets of the 12 signals to suit different query
  styles. (Already partly true — `aggressiveness` parameter shifts
  cymatics peak_width, which is a frequency-domain mode shift.)
- **Chords** — combinations of signals that sound consonant. PKI + tag
  exact + cymatics resonance is a chord that hits cleanly on
  natural-language project queries. FTS5 + SPLADE is a chord that hits
  on lexical exploration. Naming chord progressions might give us a
  vocabulary for retrieval-quality troubleshooting.

## What this gives us practically

Not much, immediately. The current code doesn't change. SIKE is still
10/10. KV-harvest is still 12% on synthetic queries. The 4-layer
attribution is what it is.

But if we ever rebrand the architecture from "13-dimensional knowledge
engine" to something more accurate, **"12-tone retrieval engine with
octave-addressed federation"** is closer to what's actually built. And
it would let us stop talking about "dimensions" (which evokes vector
spaces) and start talking about "tones" (which evokes resonance and
overlap — much closer to how cymatics-style retrieval actually works).

It also means if anyone ever tries to add a 13th retrieval signal
without first repurposing the octave gate, they should pause. Sometimes
the most elegant move is "don't add a tone — drop into a different
octave instead."

## Cymatics would approve

Cymatics studies how vibrations create geometric patterns in matter.
Twelve-fold symmetries are everywhere in the empirical record:

- 12 zodiac divisions of the celestial sphere (just observation, not
  physics, but they noticed)
- 12 cranial nerves
- 12 ribs in human anatomy
- 12 inches in a foot, 12 hours, 12 months, 12 jurors
- 12 edges on a cube — the simplest 3D solid
- 12 faces on a dodecahedron — Plato's "fifth element"
- 12 semitones in the chromatic scale — the basis of Western music
- 12 pentagons on a soccer ball
- 12-fold quasicrystal symmetries (Shechtman, Nobel 2011)
- The icosahedral capsids of many viruses (5- and 3-fold axes
  intersecting at 12 vertices)

Twelve is a number that systems converge to when they need to balance
discrimination with periodicity. We didn't aim for it. We just kept
adding signals that solved real problems, and when we counted them, we
hit 12.

This document exists to mark that we noticed.

If this framing holds up over the next few benches, it could become the
public framing of the architecture: **a 12-tone retrieval engine with
biological substrate, octave-addressed identity, and language only at
the edges.** Whether or not we use that exact phrasing, the periodicity
itself is a real structural fact about what's built.

## Footnote — SR Tier 5.5 (2026-04-13)

Sprint 2 shipped Successor Representation as `Tier 5.5` (commit
`c9367f8`, flag `retrieval.sr_enabled`, default false). SR is a
γ-discounted multi-hop generalization of Tier 5's harmonic
(1-hop co-activation) boost — mathematically the same tone played across
a longer horizon, not a new frequency. Reading this against the 12-tone
framing: SR **absorbs into Tier 5** (same co-activation substrate,
different step count), preserving the 12-count. If we ever decide it
stands alone it becomes the chromatic 13th and we need a semitone
story — but the cleaner reading is that harmonic and SR are the same
tone at different k, the way a plucked string and its sustained
resonance are the same note at different envelopes. Either way, the
"don't add a 13th tone without a reason" rule stayed respected: SR
didn't add a signal, it deepened one.
