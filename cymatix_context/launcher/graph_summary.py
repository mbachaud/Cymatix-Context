"""
Graph summary — a read-only inventory of the graph layers in a genome.

The launcher's Knowledge store tab shows how much of each layer the active
knowledge store actually holds: documents, semantic links, document
structure, learned co-activation and entities. It is a ledger, not a
renderer; nothing here draws a node or an edge.

Two things keep it cheap enough to sit behind a two-second poll:

  * every read opens its own short-lived `mode=ro` connection with
    `PRAGMA query_only=ON`, built with `Path.as_uri()` the way
    `cymatix_context/cli/cmd_status.py` builds it, so a running cymatix
    holding the store for writes is never blocked;
  * results are cached by resolved path for `GRAPH_SUMMARY_TTL_S`, so the
    poll costs a dict lookup and the aggregation runs about twice a
    minute.

Distinct undirected COVER pairs are the one expensive count. sqlite serves
that `GROUP BY` with a temp B-tree over every COVER row and no index can
help a grouping on computed expressions, so the query is skipped above
`COVER_LINKS_MAX_ROWS` and the panel reports stored rows instead.

Nothing in this module raises into the collector: an unreadable store
returns an unavailable payload whose reason goes to the log, never to the
page.

The `.modal-backdrop[hidden]` guard the design spec also mentions already
ships in `launcher.css` and is covered by
`tests/test_launcher_dashboard_wiring.py::test_modal_backdrop_has_hidden_display_guard`.
