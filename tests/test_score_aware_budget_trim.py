"""Tests for the score-aware budget-trimmer (#58).

Under sequence_index ordering (the default for narrative coherence on
factual/multi_hop queries without an answer_slate), the budget-overflow
trim used to drop ``parts[-1]`` — whichever gene happened to land last
in the assembled prompt. If the highest-scored gene was near the end
of the file, that's exactly the gene that got dropped.

This module pins the score-aware behavior with monotonicity assertions
that don't depend on exact token-count tuning: regardless of how many
genes the trim ends up dropping, the dropped set must be a prefix of
the score-ascending order. A higher-scored gene can never be dropped
while a lower-scored gene is still in the assembled context.

Gemini 3.1 Pro flagged this during the 2026-05-08 council session;
patch deferred to a follow-up because it conceptually sits outside
the Stage 5 caller_model_class branch routing. Spec lives in the
body of issue #58.
