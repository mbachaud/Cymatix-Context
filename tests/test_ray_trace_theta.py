"""Theta-alternation bias for ray_trace (Sprint 2 item 6).

Wang/Foster/Pfeiffer (2020) Science 370:247 — place-cell alternation
sweeps forward then backward within each theta cycle. Under
velocity-input TCM (Howard 2005) the session's current context vector
carries the velocity direction; biasing ray-trace neighbour sampling
along ±velocity per-bounce implements the theta sweep over the
co-activation graph.
