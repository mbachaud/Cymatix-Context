"""Doc tests for the native-observability-sidecar README scope.

Asserts that the docs say what the spec promises:

1. Root README:
   - has a "Native observability (default)" section under Quick Start.
   - mentions the bootstrap script run, tray-managed lifecycle, balloon
     notification, and the HELIX_OBSERVABILITY=0 opt-out.
   - demotes the docker-compose path to an "Advanced" footnote pointing at
     deploy/otel/README.md.
2. deploy/otel/README.md:
   - exists; framed as the alternate Docker path (not deprecated).
   - lists all five services with the same ports as the native sidecar.
   - links back to the native sidecar / spec for the shared-config story.
3. tools/native-otel/README.md:
   - still accurate post Tasks 3-10: per-user state dir, install script,
     idempotent re-run, .versions pinning.

The tests are textual — they do not import any module — so they run on
any host without the launcher extras installed.
